# TODO

Priority:
- deploy and test on Heroku
- package for submission 

Extra functionality:
- user editing/deletion, admin version
- show testreports per user
- my account: password change
- tester can edit only his own tests
- edit timestamp if a report was edited

Cosmetics/user convenience:
- forms look cluttered, align them, layout&colour stuff
- confirmation on successful operations
- wrap long continuous texts in viewreport
- editing the testreport makes more sense in the full view
  
More ideas:
- real backend SQL server & deployment
- make the insecure version and submit to WebGoat 8.0
- more detailed access control scheme
  - role enumeration, implement role class
- user registration + email verification
